Steam-Browser
=============

CLI to browse installed steam games in the provided directory. Intended for use in scripting, although use as you wish. The example script "steamgame.sh" shows one use of the program with dmenu to create a quick steam game launcher. 

If it is desired and people want it, support for other app properties can be added (such as file size or other intricacies.) Although until then, this is what it is!

Enjoy
